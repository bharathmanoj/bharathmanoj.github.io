        <p>The OS includes some common core components, like the GNU tools, among others. These tools give the user a way to manage the resources provided by the kernel, install additional software, configure performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the functional operating system. Because Linux is an open source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions.</p>
        <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides a standard operating environment for everything your enterprise does in every environment—powering the apps that run your business across bare-metal, virtual, containerized, and private and public clouds. Plus, customers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux gain economic advantages of more than US$1 trillion each year, just because of the OS.</p>
        <p>Linux has become the largest open sources software project in the world. Professional and hobbyist programmers from around the world contribute to the Linux kernel, adding features, finding and fixing bugs and security flaws, and providing new ideas—all while sharing their contributions back to the community.</p>
